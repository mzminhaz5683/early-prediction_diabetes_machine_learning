Note: To make github directory simple I have to erase github logs & unnecesary files/folders of it too.
The true case of it before erasing is in 'info/image_of_true_case' location. I have 38 git-commits to finish project.

For linux user ------
1. Install all the requirements mentioned in the file 'requirements_pip3.sh'
    >> You can run the entire file by typing './requirements_pip3.sh' in terminal at the file location.
2. Using the run.sh file you can run this project by typing './run.sh' in terminal at the file location.
    or,
        > At the 'run.sh' location type these commands to run the perticular section
        > python3 -m programs.project_model_v11_2       >>> For full project with all algorithms
        > python3 -m programs.project_model_v11         >>> For full project with best algorithms
        > python3 -m programs.ann_model_v4              >>> For ann model, change
                                                            activate_train = 1 in controler.py file to run with training
        > python3 -m programs.project_v3_actual_split   >>> For data preprocessing with the set in input folder    
        > python3 -m programs.project_v5_random_split   >>> For data preprocessing
        >>>>>>>> In controler.py file change the parameters' values to get effect on runtime
